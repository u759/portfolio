## Preface

If you were like me, you probably endlessly browsed online forums about the UBC Engineering program, life on campus, clubs, how difficult the workload is, the dreaded team projects, and getting a second-year specialization. I can speak for all but the latter; I’m working on a 2nd-year review as we speak.

Some context: I entered UBC with AP credits for English, Calculus, and Humanities. Thus, I skipped MATH 100 (differential calculus) and WRDS 150 (Writing and Research). Other than that I pretty much experienced the whole package. I got a single-room shared-bathroom dorm on campus with a meal plan.

I can say right now that, most likely, you will be fine. I chose UBC because I am local, I like building random things, and UBC is, statistically at least, among the top engineering schools in Canada. There are some caveats to this justification, but if you, among others, chose UBC for similar reasons, don’t fret. The courses are a step up in terms of technical content, but generally there are lots of online resources. Most classes used an online forum for students to anonymously ask questions about homework and receive help. You might feel lost or question your learning strategies in the first week or so, but the feeling quickly wears off. They teach everything from scratch, and even if you didn’t take AP or IB courses, the material is digestible and extremely learnable if you put in the time. The first semester mostly builds off the concepts and techniques you practiced in high school.

## Campus Life

#### Residence

I applied and received residence at Totem Park, həm̓ləsəm̓. It’s a newer building built after 2010, so it was nice and spacious. You will receive a room key and keycard (if not in Orchard Commons). The keycard is used to enter the building, and keys to enter your dorm. DO NOT LOSE THIS KEY, or else UBC will have to replace the lock and charge you $200. Most first years including myself received a dorm to themselves and share a bathroom with a “roommate” in the room across. This worked out quite well, and I believe my roommate and I only had bathroom timing conflicts twice (at least to my knowledge). Pretty basic room; I added some LED light strips for pizazz.

All the newer first-year dorms have Wi-Fi, but no ethernet access, so keep that in mind if you have a desktop. If you want to link your Google Home or some other smart device, you need to enter its MAC address to the ubcvisitor “wireless device registration system” for it to connect. Or you can use your own router and make your own local network from the existing Wi-Fi network, but that’s kind of a hassle.

Each bathroom is shared, and there is a standup shower stall, toilet, and sink. Make sure to keep it clean; there are inspections each semester by building staff. A quick dust, wipe, and toilet scrub should suffice.

One thing to note is that Totem Park is relatively far from most first year classes (\~10-15 minute walk). So plan your breakfast and travel times accordingly.

#### Dining Halls

There are 3 dining halls which grant you unlimited food with your meal plan. You can go anytime during open hours and stack up as much food as you want, as long as you don’t leave with it. There is a dining hall at Orchard Commons (Open Kitchen), Totem Park (Feast), and Place Vanier (Gather). All have slightly different kitchens and cuisines. If you enjoy burgers, Feast has actually decent ones. However, Open Kitchen and Gather have more variety, in my opinion. Make sure to go during actual breakfast/lunch/dinner times. If you’re like me who eats at random times like 11 AM, you will be disappointed since the chefs are usually preparing food for lunch, with nothing left from breakfast. Likewise for dinner. You can search their daily menus [here](https://ubc.nutrislice.com/menu).

For the most part, the food is alright, not great, not terrible. Do make sure to check the UBC subreddit often; I found out that Open Kitchen had a case of raw chicken and fruit flies being served with meals at one point during my first year. In any case, your UBC student card includes a $500 credit for campus restaurants beyond the dining halls, and it stays in your account until graduation. I often got food from Triple O’s at the Sauder building; their burgers are pretty good.

## Courses

In progress. Will be high-level. In the meantime, my friend Leo is working on individual course reviews, check it out [here](https://www.leozhang.co/#blog).

## Design Teams

There are many. They range from designing smart IoT devices to engineering electric Formula cars that compete internationally. I highly recommend looking into them [here](https://experience.apsc.ubc.ca/student-groups/engineering-design-teams-list) if you are hands-on or want to get some team experience. You don't even have to be an Engineering student to join! Many teams, including mine, hire students from Sauder for marketing and/or finance since we have sponsors.

Why join a design team? Typically, every year or every few years, a design team will embark on an entirely new design, following the engineering design process. This is especially relevant to Engineering students who can apply this classroom content in a practical setting. Therefore, it can be a relatively accurate depiction of a real engineering job, which many co-ops in my team attest to. You also learn A LOT of engineering skills in general, from data collection to documentation, and collaboration between different sub-teams. If you're after technical experience, there are usually sub-teams specializing in software, hardware, or mechanical engineering, each with their own budgets so you get access to special tools and resources to prototype with. Basically you get to simulate a real engineering job, and it looks great on your resume. Some teams also compete in international competitions, which is super fun (and reasonably stressful at times).

I joined the UBC AeroDesign team, which designs and builds a remote-controlled aircraft to compete in the SAE AeroDesign competition. I joined as a propulsions and controls member, but I also learned a lot about software and mechanical design. The team is very welcoming to new members, and values those than can stay for many years and learn as much as possible. Each week we have a work session, and occasional crash-course lessons on aerodynamics, PCB design, and more. Each member works on something unique, e.g. a voltage step-down circuit for the power distribution board, and has the opportunity to present their progress to the team every few weeks. It is a big commitment, so make sure you are willing to give up your time for meetings and random work sprints. Living on campus is definitely a W since our workspace was a 5 minute walk away.

Please do some research on the design teams before joining. Some teams are more competitive than others, and some have a more relaxed atmosphere. Some teams are also just better managed than others. I recommend looking at their past projects and seeing if you like the direction they are going in. And ask your friends about their experiences in a design team!

## Life Tips

(In no particular order)

Not gonna lie I wasn't the most social person in first year so i didn't attend many social events. I was lucky enough to have a high school friend in the same dorm and program, so we shared classes. It made it easier to study as we could fill in each other's gaps, and meeting others was less daunting (shoutout to Leo!). So try to find at least a friend or two to socialize with througout your university days.

School is stressful, without a doubt. But I also think a lot of the stress is self-inflicted and not warranted. For example, how many times have you finished an exam, only to overthink about a mistake you made after the fact? I personally did this, and what helped me was to actually think about the knowledge or concept I missed and quickly review it. This was way better than dwelling on it for days, and I could put my mind at ease knowing I did all I could. You also paid for school, so trade your cash for education, not mourning. Even though grades do matter, especially for specializations, you will find that grades follow in the footsteps of mindset. Passion and effort outperform intellect, every single time.

Don't get the burgers at Orchard Commons.

Try to schedule your classes so that you have enough time to walk to the next one. Traversing the campus is doable in 10-15 minutes, but chances are you will be late if you have back-to-back classes across the campus (I was literally NEVER on time for MATH 256, had to walk from the Forestry building to the MATH wing in 10 minutes).

Don't ride a bike worth more than you're willing to lose, it WILL get stolen even with a lock. A skateboard is a decent alternative since you can usually bring it inside.

Try to do homework soon after it is assigned so you don't forget about it and end up with a pile of assignments due at the same time. It also keeps you consistently productive. Also plan your days and know what you want to achieve each day of the week! It's literally a productivity and mental health cheat code.

If you don't opt-out of the U-Pass, which you don't by default, you get unlimited transit in Metro Vancouver, 24/7.

First year is challenging but I can guarantee you will be okay if you're on top of things. Some classes are objectively harder than others, but not conceptually impossible.
