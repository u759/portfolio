## Preface

If you were like me, you probably endlessly browsed online forums about the UBC Engineering program, life on campus, clubs, how difficult the workload is, the dreaded team projects, and getting a second-year specialization. I can speak for all but the latter; I’m working on a 2nd-year review as we speak.

Some context: I entered UBC with AP credits for English, Calculus, and Humanities. Thus, I skipped MATH 100 (differential calculus) and WRDS 150 (Writing and Research). Other than that I pretty much experienced the whole package. I got a single-room shared-bathroom dorm on campus with a meal plan.

I can say right now that, most likely, you will be fine. I chose UBC because I am local, I like building random things, and UBC is, statistically at least, among the top engineering schools in Canada. There are some caveats to this justification, but if you, among others, chose UBC for similar reasons, don’t fret. The courses are a step up in terms of technical content, but generally there are lots of online resources. Most classes used an online forum for students to anonymously ask questions about homework and receive help. You might feel lost or question your learning strategies in the first week or so, but the feeling quickly wears off. They teach everything from scratch, and even if you didn’t take AP or IB courses, the material is digestible and extremely learnable if you put in the time. The first semester mostly builds off the concepts and techniques you practiced in high school.

## Campus Life

#### Residence

I applied and received residence at Totem Park, həm̓ləsəm̓. It’s a newer building built after 2010, so it was nice and spacious. You will receive a room key and keycard (if not in Orchard Commons). The keycard is used to enter the building, and keys to enter your dorm. DO NOT LOSE THIS KEY, or else UBC will have to replace the lock and charge you $200. Most first years including myself received a dorm to themselves and share a bathroom with a “roommate” in the room across. This worked out quite well, and I believe my roommate and I only had bathroom timing conflicts twice (at least to my knowledge). Pretty basic room; I added some LED light strips for pizazz.

All the newer first-year dorms have Wi-Fi, but no ethernet access, so keep that in mind if you have a desktop. If you want to link your Google Home or some other smart device, you need to enter its MAC address to the ubcvisitor “wireless device registration system” for it to connect. Or you can use your own router and make your own local network from the existing Wi-Fi network, but that’s kind of a hassle.

Each bathroom is shared, and there is a standup shower stall, toilet, and sink. Make sure to keep it clean; there are inspections each semester by building staff. A quick dust, wipe, and toilet scrub should suffice.

*See [here](https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/getting-started/prospective/) for more details on residence.*

One thing to note is that Totem Park is relatively far from most first year classes (~10-15 minute walk). So plan your breakfast and travel times accordingly.

#### Dining Halls

There are 3 dining halls which grant you unlimited food with your meal plan. You can go anytime during open hours and stack up as much food as you want, as long as you don’t leave with it. There is a dining hall at Orchard Commons (Open Kitchen), Totem Park (Feast), and Place Vanier (Gather). All have slightly different kitchens and cuisines. If you enjoy burgers, Feast has actually decent ones. However, Open Kitchen and Gather have more variety, in my opinion. Make sure to go during actual breakfast/lunch/dinner times. If you’re like me who eats at random times like 11 AM, you will be disappointed since the chefs are usually preparing food for lunch, with nothing left from breakfast. Likewise for dinner. You can search their daily menus [here](https://ubc.nutrislice.com/menu).

For the most part, the food is alright, not great, not terrible. Do make sure to check the UBC subreddit often; I found out that Open Kitchen had a case of raw chicken and fruit flies being served with meals at one point during my first year. In any case, your UBC student card includes a $500 credit for campus restaurants beyond the dining halls, and it stays in your account until graduation. I often got food from Triple O’s at the Sauder building; their burgers are pretty good.
