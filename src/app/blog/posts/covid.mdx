During the covid pandemic I found that I had quite a bit of time on my hands. I honed my skills in photography and explored the outdoors through cycling. I'll share some photos I took and my experiences just for fun.

## Brief recap

Friday, March 6, 2020. This was the last day of school before spring break. It was when I snapped the photo below as I walked home. The air was cool and crisp.

## Cycling

Being online meant that I also picked up cycling! I got a used road bike and spent spring exploring Science World, Lighthouse Park, Centennial Beach, UBC, and the like.

That August, I embarked on a 600km cycling challenge to raise money for cancer research. I look back and cannot believe that I was only 15 during the pandemic. It really seems like yesterday, and there was a kind of serenity during those times of isolation. The skies were more blue, air more crisp, and leaves more green. It was a perfect time, and BC did quite well preventing COVID cases from turning into a homework question from a differential equations class.
